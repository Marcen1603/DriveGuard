# DriveGuard
The project "DriveGuard" develops a powerful program for processing traffic data using image analysis. It detects vehicles, license plates, pedestrians, road layouts, and traffic signs to enhance traffic safety and efficiency. DriveGuard also ensures data privacy by anonymizing sensitive information like individuals and license plates.
